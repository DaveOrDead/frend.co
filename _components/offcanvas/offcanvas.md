A common interface pattern for navigation on small viewports, the off-canvas component consists of a hidden panel and button toggling its visibility.

Aria-roles play an important role, `aria-hidden` is toggled when the panel is opened or closed to preserve consistency between the DOM & the accessibility tree, `aria-controls` are used to link the relevant buttons and panels.

No assumption is made about the panel containing navigation hence the lack of an `aria-role=”navigation”`, the component is simply defined as a collapsible section of the document. If navigation is contained within the panel, you can define a `<nav>` element for correct interpretation by the browser.

Keyboard navigation is enabled by default, the `ESC` key will close the panel and focusable elements within the panel aren't accessible if closed. Focus is applied to the panel when open to maintain the correct tab order.


##Usage

Accordions rely on header and panel pairs, wrapped in a single container.

~~~ html
<div class="fr-accordion js-fr-accordion">
	<h2 id="accordion-header-1" class="fr-accordion__header">...</h2>	
	<div id="accordion-panel-1" class="fr-accordion__panel">
		...
	</div>
	<h2 id="accordion-header-2" class="fr-accordion__header">...</h2>	
	<div id="accordion-panel-2" class="fr-accordion__panel">
		...
	</div>
	<h2 id="accordion-header-3" class="fr-accordion__header">...</h2>	
	<div id="accordion-panel-3" class="fr-accordion__panel">
		...
	</div>
</div>
~~~

Assign the function invocation to a variable.

~~~ js
var myOffcanvas = Froffcanvas();
~~~

###Methods

~~~ js
// remove all bindings and attributes when no longer needed
myOffcanvas.destroy();

// re-initialise as needed
myOffcanvas.init();
~~~

###Options

~~~ js
var myOffcanvas = Froffcanvas({
	selector: '.fr-offcanvas-panel',
	// panel selector, hook for JS init() method
	
	openSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-open',
	closeSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-close',
	toggleSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-toggle',
	// interactive element selectors to open/close/toggle panel
	
	readyClass: 'has-fr-offcanvas',
	// class name that will be added to <html> as offcanvas is initialised
	
	activeClass: 'fr-offcanvas-is-active',
	// class name that will be added to <html> when offcanvas is visible
	
	panelActiveClass: 'fr-offcanvas--is-active'
	// class name that will be added to the selector when offcanvas is visible
});
