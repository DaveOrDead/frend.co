A common interface pattern for navigation on small viewports, the off-canvas component consists of a hidden panel and button toggling its visibility.

ARIA roles play an important role; `aria-hidden` is toggled when the panel is opened or closed to preserve consistency between the DOM and the accessibility tree, and `aria-controls` are used to link the relevant buttons and panels.

No assumption is made about the panel containing navigation hence the lack of an `role="navigation"`. The component is simply defined as a collapsible section of the document. If navigation is contained within the panel, you can define a `<nav>` element for correct interpretation by the browser.

Keyboard navigation is enabled by default, and the `ESC` key will close the panel and focusable elements within the panel aren't accessible if closed. Focus is applied to the panel when open to maintain the correct tab order.


## Usage

Offcanvas relies on both a panel, a close button and either an open or toggle button.

~~~ html
<div class="fr-offcanvas-panel js-fr-offcanvas">
	...
	<button class="fr-offcanvas-close js-fr-offcanvas-close">Close panel</button>
</div>
<button class="fr-offcanvas-open js-fr-offcanvas-open">Open panel</button>
~~~

Assign the function invocation to a variable.

~~~ js
var myOffcanvas = Froffcanvas();
~~~

### Methods

~~~ js
// remove all bindings and attributes when no longer needed
myOffcanvas.destroy();

// re-initialise as needed
myOffcanvas.init();
~~~

### Options

~~~ js
var myOffcanvas = Froffcanvas({
	selector: '.fr-offcanvas-panel',
	// panel selector, hook for JS init() method

	openSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-open',
	closeSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-close',
	toggleSelector: '.js-fr-offcanvas-toggle',
	// interactive element selectors to open/close/toggle panel

	readyClass: 'has-fr-offcanvas',
	// class name that will be added to <html> as offcanvas is initialised

	activeClass: 'fr-offcanvas-is-active',
	// class name that will be added to <html> when offcanvas is visible

	panelActiveClass: 'fr-offcanvas--is-active'
	// class name that will be added to the selector when offcanvas is visible
});
