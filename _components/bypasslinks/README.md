Having a simple set of bypass links available, provides users the ability to bypass blocks of content that are repeated over multiple web pages. Useful for screen-readers and keyboard users, bypass links are visibly hidden until focused, when they appear at the top of the viewport.

The JavaScript part of this component is optional as the important functionality can be achieved with the correct HTML & CSS. The usability of the links can be improved however, removing the `tabindex` once the user has tabbed past the target element will not allow the user to unintentionally apply focus to a target element e.g. on click or tabbing through the document.

## Install

Frbypasslinks is available to install with `npm`. Run with the `--save` flag to add the component your project dependencies.

~~~
npm install fr-bypasslinks --save
~~~

The component will then be available to `import`.

~~~ js
import Frbypasslinks from 'fr-bypasslinks';
~~~

Functional styles for the off-canvas ([bypasslinks.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frend/frend.co/gh-pages/_components/bypasslinks/bypasslinks.css)) that are required to display the component states correctly should be referenced via a `<link>` in the `<head>` of your document, or can be integrated into your existing stylesheet.

You can read more about installing Frend components on our [About page](/about/), including details on the functional CSS and JavaScript structure.
